        <div class="text-block-4 pad-horizontal">The deSTIgma team is composed of several multi-faceted individuals, with expertise in app development, professional communication, data analytics, and more. Two core team members are members of the Sia Lab, known for its HIV diagnostic technology and global-scale commercialization. Others have conducted extensive research in the Azizi Lab and the Zuckerman Institute at Columbia University, which specialize in computational cancer biology and theoretical neuroscience, respectively. Through our research at Columbia, we are closely connected with a network of faculty, physicians, and staff who have and will continue to provide advising and mentorship throughout our growth and development. Thus, deSTIgma is well positioned to bring our solution to the public. </div>
